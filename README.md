Cross references (internal links)
---------------------------------

To create a cross reference from one page of this document to another page,
ensure that an explicit target is used so that the cross reference is pointing to a unique identifier, rather than a heading that could be repeated somewhere else in the document.

The syntax for explicit targets is as follows:

For the target:

    .. _my-page:

    My Page of Information
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the cross reference:

    To learn more about my information, see :ref:`My Page of Information <my-page>`
